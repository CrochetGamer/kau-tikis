        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

        <p class="faqs-intro">We certainly get A TON of questions about our business and processes. People want to 
            know everything from shipping costs to how we make our tikis. We get really good, questions....and at times, 
            we get really dumb questions. We answer them all here! (This is a long section, so bring popcorn along. Seriously.)
        </p>

        <h2>Questions about Our Products</h2>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Can I get a refund?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: No. We do not offer refunds. After an order is placed and 
            we deliver the item safely to the customer, it is up to the customer to care for the item.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Yeah, but I really need a refund because I didn't know this sculpture was this tall/short.</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: You should have paid attention to the information warning label located on each sculpture that 
            explains the sculpture dimensions in inches for height and width. The warning even explains that 
            you should have a measuring tape or ruler on hand so you can understand how tall/short each sculpture is. We 
            do not give refunds because you didn't read the warning section.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Can you make me a custom tiki, planter, or sculpture?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: Yes and no. At times, we may gladly accept custom 
            requests under certain circumstances. It depends on many aspects of the custom job.
            Obviously, a custom order will cost more money and will be subject to a
            custom materials charge. At times, we may decline certain custom orders 
            due to lack of time, availability of materials, or operating cost. Usually, 
            the customer declines after they realize how expensive a custom concrete 
            sculpture can be.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: I like one of your sculptures but I want you to change something on it. Can you do that?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: No, we cannot change an already created concrete sculpture to suit your needs. </p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Can you make me the same tiki but make it 4, 5, 6, or even 7 foot tall?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: No. We do not offer larger or smaller sizes of each tiki. Each tiki 
            is designed to be a specific size, and we cannot randomly make gigantic versions.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: I'd like to order a custom tiki that's 4 ft tall or bigger, with the same price 
            and shipping as the cheap plastic/resin tiki I saw on Amazon/Wayfair/Temu/Etsy. Is that possible?
        </p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: Yikes! You should really think logically about this question before you ask it. 
            You are requesting custom work to go into a huge concrete sculpture, which means that the 
            price will obviously be higher than just purchasing a cheap product online.<br><br>For a custom 
            job, we charge time and materials going into that agreement. We require all custom orders 
            to be signed by the customer before we start. That means that you have to pay for part of that custom 
            work before we start it because we have to purchase new materials and take separate time 
            apart from our regular deliveries and business hours to create your custom sculpture.<br><br>So no, just because 
            you send us a picture of a big, cheaply made, resin sculpture you found online and explain that 
            you are expecting to pay less than the online price for a custom, handmade concrete sculpture, doesn't 
            mean we are going to agree and start your sculpture.
        </p>


        <p class="question">QUESTION: Can I make anything custom?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: This depends on the order. First, we speak with the customer. It's possible they want 
            something that we just can't make or don't want to make. (Someone once asked us to make them a concrete 
            statue of a college football mascot holding the name of their son - copyright issues and our hatred for 
            sports stopped that custom order in it's tracks!)<br><br>
        </p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: What are the dimensions of this sculpture?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: Each statue and item on our website has information attached in the 
            product specification section that explains width, height, and thickness 
            in inches. We recommend referencing a measuring 
            tape or ruler if you need to see how tall or wide each sculpture is.</p>



        <p class="question">QUESTION: What is the spiritual meaning behind your tikis?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: Absolutely nothing. Our tikis are literally concrete garden art statues. If you think that 
            concrete has a spiritual meaning, then you might as well worship the sidewalk in front 
            of your house. We are Christian, and believe that Jesus Christ is God. He alone is 
            worthy of your worship, not a concrete statue that we designed for fun.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Hey...wait a minute...you're not Hawaiian! Isn't making and selling tikis considered cultural misappropriation?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: Are you going to tell me that you have to be Italian to own a pizzaria? Or how 
            about this: next time you crave Chinese food, you should slap yourself because you aren't 
            Chinese. Yeah right. And yes - people really do say dumb things like this to us.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Can you explain the price differences on bare and painted sculptures?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: Sure! When you purchase a bare concrete sculpture from us, you are receiving 
            a non-painted and non-sealed sculpture. This is the base sculpture, so it takes less time to make.
            <br><br>When you purchase a painted sculpture from us, you are receiving a painted and weatherproof-sealed 
            sculpture, which takes us much more time to make. That's why we typically charge between $5 and $30 extra per sculpture.
            (Painting and sealing price varies depending on sculpture.) <br><br>For example, our 13 inch tall 
            <a href="tikis.html">Starfish Tiki</a> costs $40 as a bare sculpture with no sealant or painting. For the painted version of the 
            same tiki, the price goes up to $60. We added $20 onto the base price to cover the cost of time and 
            materials needed to paint the tiki and seal it. We offer both versions for sale. Or, you could purchase a 
            bare tiki and paint it yourself!</p>

        <h2>Questions about Our Business & Deliveries</h2>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Do you do farmers markets?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: No. We do not attend farmers markets on the Big Island at this time.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Where are you located? Do you have a store or shop?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: We are located in Ocean View on the Big Island of Hawaii and only operate 
            through placed orders & deliveries - this means we do not have a storefront at this time.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Can you deliver to my house?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: No. We do not offer delivery to customer homes. Instead, we meet up with clients 
            in safe public places. This protects us & the customers.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Will you wholesale sculptures to my shop/business?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: No. We cannot take wholesale orders at this time.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: What days should I expect delivery to take place?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: We normally deliver on weekdays (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, 
            Thursday, Friday) and we avoid deliveries on the weekends unless every single customer 
            has to meet us on Saturday. This is due to traffic. Saturday & Sundays are too busy 
            traveling to and from Hilo & Kona and navigating in the cities.
        </p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: How much does delivery cost? To what areas do you deliver?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: Delivery in Ocean View and to Na'alehu is free, 
            but delivery to Pahala, Hilo, Kealakekua, and Kona requires a $15 fee per order. 
            We cannot deliver to Waimea due to distance. If you live in Waimea and would like 
            to order, please try to meet up with us in Hilo or Kona on the days we deliver there.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Can you waive my delivery fee? Is it really necessary?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: No we cannot waive it. Yes it is necessary. Driving to Hilo or Kona is a 4 hour 
            round trip for us. We are able to make deliveries work by charging each customer 
            $15, which covers our gas cost. This allows us to continue making deliveries.</p>
        
        <p class="question">QUESTION: Can I get a discount on bulk quantities?</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: No. We do not offer discounts on bulk quantities as each piece takes several days to make.</p>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: Can't you cut me some kind of deal? </p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: No. All customers are charged the same price. We do run sales every now and then, 
            so be on the look out and sign up for our newsletter for coupon codes. </p>

        <h2>The Ultimate Question</h2>

        <p class="question">QUESTION: How can I be saved from my sins? I've done horrible things in my life.</p>
        <p class="answer">ANSWER: You may think this question is out of place in this FAQ section, when in fact, 
            it's the only question here that matters. Think about it - would you say you're a good person? 
            Where will you go when you die? Well, lets look at your case:<br><br>
            Have you ever lied to someone? (The Bible says ALL liars have their part in the lake of fire. Revelation )<br> 
            Have you ever stolen anything, even if it was small?<br>
            Have you looked at someone with lust? (Looked at them sexually - this includes pornography. Jesus says this is adultery 
            in the heart in Matthew )<br>
            Have you ever felt jealous of someone else?<br>
            Have you loved anyone or anything more than you love God? That's idolatry - you probably elevate your phone and your 
            social media above everything else.<br>
            Have you ever hated someone? Jesus says this is murder in Matthew <br>
            Have you ever disobeyed or dishonored your parents?<br><br>
            Well, your case doesn't look good. If you thought you were a good person, you're wrong. You've broken nearly 
            all of the 10 Commandments - that's breaking God's Law. 
            When God judges you on Judgement Day, you'll be guilty and sent to a horrible, permanent, flaming heat of 
            torture - and eternity never ends in Hell. You've sinned against the eternal God - and your punishment will be 
            eternal.
            <br><br>
            But there is Good News. The best news you'll ever hear. Someone stepped into God's Courtroom and willingly 
            took the punishment YOU deserve. Although YOU are the one who committed all those crimes against the God that 
            created you, Someone else stood in front of you and has borne your sins, transgressions, and punishment.
            <br><br>
            That Person is Jesus Christ. He is God Incarnate - the Word of God became a human and willingly let Himself be crucified 
            on YOUR behalf. Jesus is God in human form and was perfect in every way - He was sinless - and this meant that when He 
            gave His life on the Cross, He gave His life as a pure and perfect sacrifice for our sins.
            <br><br>
            The last words Jesus said on the Cross were, "It is finished." - in Greek, it translates to "Paid in full". He said 
            this so that we all would understand that He took the punishment we deserve - He was crucified and humiliated in front 
            of thousands of people, beaten, flogged, spit on, hit, mocked. The Bible says He was beaten so badly that He was 
            unrecognizable. He also took the wrath of the Father - the wrath that YOU have been storing up for yourself until the 
            Judgement Day. He gave up His Spirit and died on the Cross.
            <br><br>
            Three days later, Jesus was resurrected - proving that He was who He said He was - God in human flesh! He appeared before 
            all the Apostles and was also seen by more than 500 disciples at one time. It's no fairy tale - Jesus' life and resurrection 
            is one of the most heavily documented accounts in history.
            <br><br>
            Now, all you have to do in order to be saved is to repent of your sins (recognize that you are a sinner and that you have 
            sinned against God and need a Savior) and place all of your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, give your whole life to Jesus and 
            believe and love Him with all your heart and you will be saved. After you've done this, you are considered clean and renewed 
            in the eyes of the Father - you are covered with the righteousness of Jesus and have been born again through the Holy Spirit.
            <br><br>
            Now what do you do? Do works befitting repentance (you've been saved, now go do something about it!) Overflow with the fruit of the Spirit! Spread the Good News about Jesus to 
            everyone. Read your Bible and find a good, Bible teaching church - stay away from organizations like Jehovah Witnesses, Latter Day 
            Saints (Mormons), and Catholicism - which all teach that you must do good works in order to be saved. (The truth is, we will sin 
            and do horrible things our entire lives and will never be good enough to gain or merit entry to Heaven - that's why we place 
            all of our faith in Jesus Christ, who IS good enough.)
            <br><br>
            Father, we pray that the Holy Spirit will convict each person who reads this of their sin and bring them to repentance - we pray that 
            they wouldn't have peace concerning their sin until they repent and come to the Lord Jesus. We pray this in the Name of the Lord 
            Jesus Christ. Amen.
