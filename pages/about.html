            <h1>About Ka'u Tikis</h1>
            <p>We are a locally owned, Christian family business located on the Big Island of Hawaii in Ocean View. 
                Our love of tikis, gardening, and the timeless beauty of Hawaii has been blended together 
                into a family business. We strive for excellence in each tiki, stepping stone, and statue that we make. 
                Each product is lovingly handcrafted and handled with care. 
            </p>
